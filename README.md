# command-pack
Adds helpful tools for Minecraft command users.

I will add more features as I make YouTube videos on command tools.

These tools include predicates, item modifiers and a bunch of other things
that can build ontop of each other to create much more detailed creations. Alongside this,
I will make features such as 'command dictionaries'. These allow you to store commands in a 
storage unit for loading into command blocks by the use of functions.

Make sure to read the changelogs each month to check for new content if you're interested.
